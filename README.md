# SignalDelay

This mod adds signal delay for probes in KSP, based on their CommNet connectivity. It means that you will only see the commands you issue after the radio wave reaches the vessel and returns back. Controlling interplanetary probes gets harder but more realistic.

The mod is in beta. Please report bugs via the Issues tab and attach the output log.

## Known Issues

- The mod doesn't handle part actions (e.g. experiment deployment), so they are not delayed. If you find it cheaty, you can choose to hide them, in the Settings, and use action groups instead.
- RCS linear translation (HNJLIK keys) is not supported at the moment. I haven't figured out how to execute these actions.
